# 📡 ESP32 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth Jammer

This is a powerful and portable RF disruptor built using the ESP32. It blasts out continuous interference across the 2.4 GHz band, using either sweeping or hopping channel modes. It's controlled by a physical toggle switch and optimized for high-output jamming.

## 🚀 Features

* Constant RF signal transmission across 2.4 GHz channels  
* Toggle switch for:
  * Channel Sweeping (0–78)
  * Channel Hopping (2-step jump with bounce-back)
* Disables WiFi and Bluetooth for raw RF performance  
* High-speed SPI and max output power settings  
* Fully USB-powered and compact build
